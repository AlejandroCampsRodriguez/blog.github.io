      <h1>A Guide to Functional Programming</h1> 
     <div class="font"> Functional programming has gained popularity due to its ability to provide efficient and scalable solutions. It's a declarative approach to programming, where the focus is on specifying what the program should accomplish, rather than how it should accomplish it.

      In this post, we'll look into the core concepts and advantages of functional programming, as well as explore some of the most popular functional programming languages.</div>
      
      <p><h3>What is Functional Programming?üòô</h3></p>
    <div class="font">
      Functional programming is a declarative programming paradigm that focuses on applying pure functions in sequence to solve complex problems. It treats functions as first-class citizens, allowing them to be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from functions, and stored in data structures.
      üëâFunctional programming excels at mathematical functions where values don't have any correlation and doesn't make use of concepts like shared state and mutable data used in object-oriented programming.
      Core Concepts of Functional Programming<br>
    </div>
     <h4> #Ô∏è‚É£1-First-class functions: üöÄ</h4>
    <div class="font">
      Functions are treated as data type variables and can be used like any other variables.
      Example 1: In JavaScript, we can pass a function as an argument to another function, just like we would pass a variable.
    </div>

    <div  class="img d-flex justify-content-center" >  
       <img  src="../assets/images/programming-components-00.png" alt="imagen ">
    </div>
  <p>
    <h4> #Ô∏è‚É£2-Recursion:üöÄ</h4>     
<div class="font">
  Functional programs avoid constructions that create different outputs on every execution. Instead, recursive functions call themselves repeatedly until they reach the desired state or solution known as the base case.
Example: In Python, we can use recursion to calculate the factorial of a number.
</div> 
 </p>
  <div  class="img d-flex justify-content-center" >  
    <img src="../assets//images/programming-components-01.png" alt="">
    </div>
    <div class="font">
      In this example, the factorial function calls itself repeatedly until it reaches the base case (n == 0), at which point it returns the final result.
    </div>
<p>


        <h4> #Ô∏è‚É£3-Immutability:üöÄ</h4>
  
     <div class="font">
      Variables cannot be modified after being created. This ensures that the program's state remains constant throughout its runtime.
     Example: In Haskell, we can create an immutable list and then use a function   to create a new list with the elements transformed.
     </div>
     <div  class="img d-flex justify-content-center" >  
      <img src="../assets//images/programming-components-03.png" alt="">
      </div>        
    </p>

   <div class="font">
    In this example, the myList variable is immutable, and we create a new list doubleList by applying the map function to myList. The original list remains unchanged.

   </div>
<div  class="img d-flex justify-content-center" >  
<img src="../assets/images/programming-components-04.png" alt="">
</div>
<p>
  <h4> #Ô∏è‚É£4-Pure functions:üöÄ</h4>
 <div class="font">
  Pure functions produce the same output if the given input is the same and have no side effects.

  Example: In JavaScript, we can create a pure function that takes a string as input and returns the string with all vowels removed.
 </div>

    <div  class="img d-flex justify-content-center" >  
      <img src="../assets/images/programming-components-05.png" alt="">
      </div>
      <div class="font">
        In this example, the removeVowels function takes a string as input and returns a new string with all vowels removed. The function has no side effects and always returns the same output given the same input.
      </div>
</p>

<p>
  <h4> #Ô∏è‚É£5-High-order functions:üöÄ</h4>
     <div class="font">
      Functions that accept other functions as parameters or return functions as outputs.
     </div>
 

  <div  class="img d-flex justify-content-center" >  
    <img src="../assets/images/programming-components-06.png" alt="">
    </div>
   <div class="font">
    In this example, the applyFunction function takes another function (double or square) as an argument, and applies it to a list of numbers. The function returns a new list with the results of applying the function to each number.
    Example 2: Haskell's high-order functions accept other functions as parameters or return functions as outputs.üëáüëá

    <h4> üíªAdvantages of Functional Programming</h4>
   <li>Easy to debug: Pure functions produce the same output as the given input, making it easier to check for errors in code.</li>
   <li>Lazy evaluation: Computations are only evaluated when needed, reducing unnecessary computations.</li>
   <li>Supports parallel programming: Immutable variables make it easy to create parallel programs, reducing the amount of change within the program.</li>
   <li>Easy to read: Functions are easy to read and understand, making it easier to understand the codebase and purpose.</li>
   <li>Efficient: Functional programs don't rely on external sources or variables, making them easily reusable across the program.</li>
   </ol>
</div>
  <h4> üëçDrawbacks of Functional Programming</h4>
<div class="font">
  <ol>
    <li>Terminology problems: Functional programming has a lot of terminologies that may be difficult to explain to a layman.</li>
    <li>Recursion: Although recursion is a powerful feature, it can be expensive to use, requiring higher memory usage.</li>
